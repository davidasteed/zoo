# zoo
week 6 day 1

Author: David Steed

Assigment:  Learn to work with classes: constructors, parent constructor ( super() ), basic inheritance, static functions, member functions and properties, overriding functions.  Each class has basic tests (try/throw/catch) implemented to propagate errors to the test/validation statements in visizoo.js.

How to start:
1) Clone the repository
2) Open an iterm 2 terminal window, and start http-server via:   http-server src
3) Go to the web page that is started and open the inspector
4) The console messages there show the output of the tests/validation statements from visitzoo.js
